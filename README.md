# CO2-Emissions-by-Vehicle
Predicting CO2 Emissions Based on Vehicle Features
## Objective ##
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the CO2 emissions of vehicles based on various features such as engine size, number of cylinders, transmission type, number of gears, fuel consumption, and vehicle class. This analysis will highlight key factors influencing emissions and provide insights into reducing environmental impact.
