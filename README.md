# CO2 Emissions by Vehicle
Predicting CO2 Emissions Based on Vehicle Features
## Objective ##
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the CO2 emissions of vehicles based on various features such as engine size, number of cylinders, transmission type, number of gears, fuel consumption, and vehicle class. This analysis will highlight key factors influencing emissions and provide insights into reducing environmental impact.

## Questions Explored within the Dataset ##
1. Which vehicle features most significantly affect CO2 emissions?
     - Analysis of the correlation between CO2 emissions and different features such as engine size, fuel type, and transmission type.
2. How do different vehicle classes compare in terms of average CO2 emissions?
     - Comparison of emissions across vehicle classes.
3. Can we accurately predict CO2 emissions using a regression model?
     - Linear regression through developing and evaluating predictive models.
